## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](https://eslint.org):

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev eslint
# or
$ yarn add --dev eslint
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-testing-library`:

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-testing-library
# or
$ yarn add --dev eslint-plugin-testing-library
```

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `eslint-plugin-testing-library` globally.

## Migrating

You can find detailed guides for migrating `eslint-plugin-testing-library` in the [migration guide docs](docs/migration-guides):

- [Migrate guide for v4](docs/migration-guides/v4.md)
- [Migrate guide for v5](docs/migration-guides/v5.md)

## Usage

Add `testing-library` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc.js` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```js
module.exports = {
	plugins: ['testing-library'],
};
```

Then configure the rules you want to use within `rules` property of your `.eslintrc`:

```js
module.exports = {
	rules: {
		'testing-library/await-async-query': 'error',
		'testing-library/no-await-sync-query': 'error',
		'testing-library/no-debugging-utils': 'warn',
		'testing-library/no-dom-import': 'off',
	},
};
```

### Run the plugin only against test files

With the default setup mentioned before, `eslint-plugin-testing-library` will be run against your whole codebase. If you want to run this plugin only against your tests files, you have the following options:

#### ESLint `overrides`

One way of restricting ESLint config by file patterns is by using [ESLint `overrides`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#configuration-based-on-glob-patterns).

Assuming you are using the same pattern for your test files as [Jest by default](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testmatch-arraystring), the following config would run `eslint-plugin-testing-library` only against your test files:

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
	// 1) Here we have our usual config which applies to the whole project, so we don't put testing-library preset here.
	extends: ['airbnb', 'plugin:prettier/recommended'],

	// 2) We load other plugins than eslint-plugin-testing-library globally if we want to.
	plugins: ['react-hooks'],

	overrides: [
		{
			// 3) Now we enable eslint-plugin-testing-library rules or preset only for matching testing files!
			files: ['**/__tests__/**/*.[jt]s?(x)', '**/?(*.)+(spec|test).[jt]s?(x)'],
			extends: ['plugin:testing-library/react'],
		},
	],
};
```

#### ESLint Cascading and Hierarchy

Another approach for customizing ESLint config by paths is through [ESLint Cascading and Hierarchy](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#cascading-and-hierarchy). This is useful if all your tests are placed under the same folder, so you can place there another `.eslintrc` where you enable `eslint-plugin-testing-library` for applying it only to the files under such folder, rather than enabling it on your global `.eslintrc` which would apply to your whole project.

## Shareable configurations

This plugin exports several recommended configurations that enforce good practices for specific Testing Library packages.
You can find more info about enabled rules in the [Supported Rules section](#supported-rules), under the `Configurations` column.

Since each one of these configurations is aimed at a particular Testing Library package, they are not extendable between them, so you should use only one of them at once per `.eslintrc` file. For example, if you want to enable recommended configuration for React, you don't need to combine it somehow with DOM one:

```js
// ❌ Don't do this
module.exports = {
	extends: ['plugin:testing-library/dom', 'plugin:testing-library/react'],
};
```

```js
// ✅ Just do this instead
module.exports = {
	extends: ['plugin:testing-library/react'],
};
```

### DOM Testing Library

Enforces recommended rules for DOM Testing Library.

To enable this configuration use the `extends` property in your
`.eslintrc.js` config file:

```js
module.exports = {
	extends: ['plugin:testing-library/dom'],
};
```

### Angular

Enforces recommended rules for Angular Testing Library.

To enable this configuration use the `extends` property in your
`.eslintrc.js` config file:

```js
module.exports = {
	extends: ['plugin:testing-library/angular'],
};
```

### React

Enforces recommended rules for React Testing Library.

To enable this configuration use the `extends` property in your
`.eslintrc.js` config file:

```js
module.exports = {
	extends: ['plugin:testing-library/react'],
};
```

### Vue

Enforces recommended rules for Vue Testing Library.

To enable this configuration use the `extends` property in your
`.eslintrc.js` config file:

```js
module.exports = {
	extends: ['plugin:testing-library/vue'],
};
```

### Marko

Enforces recommended rules for Marko Testing Library.

To enable this configuration use the `extends` property in your
`.eslintrc.js` config file:

```js
module.exports = {
	extends: ['plugin:testing-library/marko'],
};
```

## Supported Rules

## Aggressive Reporting

In v4 this plugin introduced a new feature called "Aggressive Reporting", which intends to detect Testing Library utils usages even if they don't come directly from a Testing Library package (i.e. [using a custom utility file to re-export everything from Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup/#custom-render)). You can [read more about this feature here](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#aggressive-reporting).

If you are looking to restricting or switching off this feature, please refer to the [Shared Settings section](#shared-settings) to do so.

## Shared Settings

There are some configuration options available that will be shared across all the plugin rules. This is achieved using [ESLint Shared Settings](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/configuration-files#adding-shared-settings). These Shared Settings are meant to be used if you need to restrict or switch off the Aggressive Reporting, which is an out of the box advanced feature to lint Testing Library usages in a simpler way for most of the users. **So please before configuring any of these settings**, read more about [the advantages of `eslint-plugin-testing-library` Aggressive Reporting feature](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#aggressive-reporting), and [how it's affected by these settings](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#shared-settings).

If you are sure about configuring the settings, these are the options available:

### `testing-library/utils-module`

The name of your custom utility file from where you re-export everything from the Testing Library package, or `"off"` to switch related Aggressive Reporting mechanism off. Relates to [Aggressive Imports Reporting](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#imports).

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
	settings: {
		'testing-library/utils-module': 'my-custom-test-utility-file',
	},
};
```

[You can find more details about the `utils-module` setting here](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#testing-libraryutils-module).

### `testing-library/custom-renders`

A list of function names that are valid as Testing Library custom renders, or `"off"` to switch related Aggressive Reporting mechanism off. Relates to [Aggressive Renders Reporting](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#renders).

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
	settings: {
		'testing-library/custom-renders': ['display', 'renderWithProviders'],
	},
};
```

[You can find more details about the `custom-renders` setting here](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#testing-librarycustom-renders).

### `testing-library/custom-queries`

A list of query names/patterns that are valid as Testing Library custom queries, or `"off"` to switch related Aggressive Reporting mechanism off. Relates to [Aggressive Reporting - Queries](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#queries)

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
	settings: {
		'testing-library/custom-queries': ['ByIcon', 'getByComplexText'],
	},
};
```

[You can find more details about the `custom-queries` setting here](docs/migration-guides/v4.md#testing-librarycustom-queries).

### Switching all Aggressive Reporting mechanisms off

Since each Shared Setting is related to one Aggressive Reporting mechanism, and they accept `"off"` to opt out of that mechanism, you can switch the entire feature off by doing:

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
	settings: {
		'testing-library/utils-module': 'off',
		'testing-library/custom-renders': 'off',
		'testing-library/custom-queries': 'off',
	},
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Errors reported in non-testing files

If you find ESLint errors related to `eslint-plugin-testing-library` in files other than testing, this could be caused by [Aggressive Reporting](#aggressive-reporting).

You can avoid this by:

1. [running `eslint-plugin-testing-library` only against testing files](#run-the-plugin-only-against-test-files)
2. [limiting the scope of Aggressive Reporting through Shared Settings](#shared-settings)
3. [switching Aggressive Reporting feature off](#switching-all-aggressive-reporting-mechanisms-off)

If you think the error you are getting is not related to this at all, please [fill a new issue](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library/issues/new/choose) with as many details as possible.

### False positives in testing files

If you are getting false positive ESLint errors in your testing files, this could be caused by [Aggressive Reporting](#aggressive-reporting).

You can avoid this by:

1. [limiting the scope of Aggressive Reporting through Shared Settings](#shared-settings)
2. [switching Aggressive Reporting feature off](#switching-all-aggressive-reporting-mechanisms-off)

If you think the error you are getting is not related to this at all, please [fill a new issue](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library/issues/new/choose) with as many details as possible.
